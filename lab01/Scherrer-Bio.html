My name is Jake Scherrer I an information and technologies major and am interested in this because I have used computers all my life
and want to learn more about creating things on the internet. Last year I took a Python course and creaetd a final project I was
proud of, however I want to eventually be able to put that inforamtion onto an actual website that is easy to access. I love to
watch movies, shows, and play soccer occasionally, and often find myself engrossed in video games. Many of my hobbies surround my
computer and I hope to add this to my skills and hobbies.
